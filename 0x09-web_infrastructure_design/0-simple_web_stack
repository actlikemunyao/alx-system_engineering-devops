# 0. Simple Web Stack

**Infrastructure Description:**
- 1 physical server with Ubuntu 20.04
- Domain name: `www.foobar.com` pointing to server IP `8.8.8.8`
- Server runs: Nginx (reverse proxy), Gunicorn (application server), MySQL (database), App code

**Component Roles:**
- **DNS (A record)**: Resolves `www.foobar.com` to `8.8.8.8`
- **Nginx**: Serves static content and forwards dynamic requests to Gunicorn
- **Gunicorn**: Runs the Python web app
- **MySQL**: Stores data used by the app
- **App code**: Business logic

**Communication Flow:**
- Client → DNS → Nginx → Gunicorn → MySQL

**Drawbacks:**
- Single point of failure (SPOF)
- Not scalable or redundant
- Downtime during updates
