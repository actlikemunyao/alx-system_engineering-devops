# 2. Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure

**Infrastructure Description:**
- Load balancer with SSL termination
- HTTPS traffic only
- Firewalls between each layer
- Monitoring (DataDog/SumoLogic) on each component

**Component Roles:**
- **SSL Termination at LB**: Secures traffic from client
- **Firewalls**: Protects each layer (web/app/db)
- **Monitoring Agents**: Track logs, requests, errors

**Communication Flow:**
- Client → DNS → HTTPS Load Balancer → App Servers → DB Server
- Monitoring agents send data to external dashboard

**Improvements:**
- Encrypted traffic (HTTPS)
- Monitored metrics and logs
- Firewalls reduce attack surface

**Remaining Issues:**
- DB still a single write point
- SSL only at LB (internal traffic unencrypted)
