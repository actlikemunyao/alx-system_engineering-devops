# 1. Distributed Web Infrastructure

**Infrastructure Description:**
- Load balancer (HAProxy)
- Two app servers (Nginx + Gunicorn)
- One MySQL DB server
- DNS resolves `www.foobar.com` to the load balancer

**Component Roles:**
- **Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic using Round Robin
- **App Servers**: Serve app code and static assets
- **MySQL DB**: Stores persistent data

**Communication Flow:**
- Client → DNS → Load Balancer → App Servers → MySQL

**Improvements:**
- Redundancy for app layer
- Reduced load on individual app servers

**Issues:**
- Single DB is still a SPOF
- No HTTPS or monitoring yet
